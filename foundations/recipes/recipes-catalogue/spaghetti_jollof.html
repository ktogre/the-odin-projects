    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Jollof is a savory, tomato-based pasta dish.
        <br>
        It's often cooked with peppers, onions, and seasoning cubes, giving it that rich, smoky
        jollof-like
        taste.
        <br>
        It is often served with fried plantains, boiled eggs, or grilled chicken.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 medium tomatoes (blended)</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper (tatashe)</li>
        <li>2 scotch bonnet peppers (atarodo)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 seasoning cubes (Maggi or Knorr)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1½ cups chicken stock or water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the pepper mix:
            Blend tomatoes, red bell pepper, and scotch bonnets until smooth. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Boil the spaghetti:
            Cook spaghetti in salted boiling water until almost done (al dente). Drain and set aside, don't rinse.
        </li>
        <li>Make the sauce:
            Heat oil in a pan, add chopped onions, and sauté until translucent.
            Stir in tomato paste and fry for 2 minutes to remove the raw taste.
        </li>
        <li>Add blended pepper mix:
            Pour in the blended mixture and cook on medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally until the
            sauce
            thickens and the oil begins to separate.
        </li>
        <li>Season the sauce:
            Add curry, thyme, seasoning cubes, and salt. Mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Combine spaghetti and sauce:
            Add the boiled spaghetti into the sauce. Pour in chicken stock or water as needed. Mix gently until
            everything is coated evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Add proteins (optional):
            Stir in sausages, shredded chicken, or beef. Reduce heat and allow to steam for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot:
            Garnish with sliced onions or vegetables. Best enjoyed with fried plantain or boiled egg.
        </li>
