    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, marinated in rich spices like
        curry, thyme, and ginger before being deep-fried to perfection.
        <br>
        It's often served alongside jollof rice,
        spaghetti, or fried plantain, making it a favorite for parties and Sunday lunches.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg chicken pieces (drumsticks, wings, or thighs)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>2 seasoning cubes (Maggi or Knorr)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika or cayenne pepper (optional for heat)</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (for coating)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for deep frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Marinate the chicken:
            In a bowl, combine chicken pieces with onions, garlic, ginger, curry, thyme, salt, black pepper, seasoning
            cubes, and lemon juice.
            Mix thoroughly, cover, and let it marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for deeper flavor).
        </li>
        <li>Parboil the chicken:
            Transfer the marinated chicken into a pot. Add about half a cup of water and steam on medium heat for 10–15
            minutes until the chicken is tender and juices release.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare for frying:
            Remove the chicken and let it cool slightly.
            Roll each piece in all-purpose flour to coat evenly. Shake off excess flour.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil:
            Pour vegetable oil into a deep frying pan or pot. Heat until moderately hot (about 170–180°C).</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken:
            Fry the pieces in batches — avoid overcrowding the pan.
            Turn occasionally until each side is golden brown and crisp (about 8–10 minutes per batch).</li>
        <li>Drain and rest:
            Remove the fried chicken and place it on paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve hot:
            Perfect with jollof rice, spaghetti, fried rice, or coleslaw.</li>
    </ol>
