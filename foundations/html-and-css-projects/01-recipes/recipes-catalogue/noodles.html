    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g egg noodles (or any instant or spaghetti noodles)</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot (julienned)</li>
        <li>½ red bell pepper (sliced thinly)</li>
        <li>½ green bell pepper (sliced thinly)</li>
        <li>½ onion (sliced)</li>
        <li>1 cup cabbage (shredded)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional, for aroma)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the noodles:
            Boil noodles according to package instructions until just tender (not mushy).
            Drain and toss lightly in a teaspoon of oil to prevent sticking. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the vegetables:
            Wash and slice all vegetables thinly for even cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil:
            In a wok or large frying pan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
            Add minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>Stir-fry the vegetables:
            Add onions, carrots, and bell peppers. Stir-fry for about 2 to 3 minutes until slightly tender but still
            crisp.
            Add cabbage last and stir briefly.
        </li>
        <li>Add the noodles:
            Toss in the cooked noodles. Add soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil (if using).
            Mix everything thoroughly so the sauce coats the noodles evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Add seasoning and protein (optional):
            Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
            If using scrambled eggs, chicken, or shrimp, add them now and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot:
            Garnish with a sprinkle of spring onions or sesame seeds if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
