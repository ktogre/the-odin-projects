# Fullstack Web Development Journey - Phase 1

> Part of my Developer Roadmap — building across **Blockchain**, **Web**, and **App** to master full-stack decentralized development.

This repository marks the beginning of my **Fullstack Web Development** journey, following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.  
It focuses on mastering the **core web technologies** that form the foundation of every modern developer's toolkit.
