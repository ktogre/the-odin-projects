# The Odin Project

## Overview
This repository is a collection of the projects I built following the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

It tracks my progress as I develop the following core skills:
- foundational frontend skills (HTML and CSS)
- JavaScript knowledge
- Frameworks (React) and DataBases
- Backend skills (Node js)
- 
All in accordance with the odin project curriculum.

`This repo is still active as additonal projects will be added as I progress with the Odin project curriculum`

## Projects Structure
Projects are categorized into two, in accordance with how the odin project is structured.
- foundations/ 
- javascript/
- full-stack-javascript/

The projects in the `foundations/` demonstate the use of basic HTML elements (`anchor<a>`, `img`, `h1 to h3`) and CSS (`CSS Box model[box-sizing and content-box]`, `CSS flexbox`).

The projects in `javascript/` demonstrate the use of foundational JavaScripts (`variables and operators`, `Data types and conditonals` and `Function basics`). 
**Note:** The `javascript/` section is still in progress...

The projects in the `full-stack-javascript/`: **Not Started**
